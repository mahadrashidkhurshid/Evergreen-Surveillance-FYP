# Evergreen-Surveillance-FYP

We hae developed a system in which we search for a location and through Google maps API it gets the satellite view of that location ater which a filter is applied with highlights the green portion of the image using HSV method. And a predictor that predicts 1, 15 and 30 AQI level of the city. 

This system is best for Government, NGS's, Enviroment Oganization etc. that can use the satellite view and detect which area needs plantation in order to make a better enviroment and bring AQI to healthy level.
